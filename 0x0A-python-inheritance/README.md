## Python - Inheritance
Inheritance is a concept in OOP that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, sharing a set of properties and methods, by deriving a class from another class

This, in simple terms, allows you to share the properties of another class(base class)

### Why Inheritance?
- Provides reusability of code (common structures can be shared without being re-written)
- Cuts down on development time and maintenance expenses
- Provides a cleare representation of real-world relationships

### Key Concepts
 - What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
 - What is a subclass
 - How to inherit from another class
 - How to define a class with multiple base classes
 - What is the default class every class inherits from
 - How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
 - Which methods or attributes are available by heritage to subclasses
 - What is the purpose of inheritance
 - How to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type` and the `super` built-in functions
