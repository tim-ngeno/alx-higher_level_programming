## Python - Almost a Circle
This project, "Python - Almost a Circle," focuses on implementing classes for rectangles and squares in Python. It covers various objectives and concepts related to working with classes and handling data.

## Objectives
The project covers the following objectives:

### Unit testing and implementation in a large project:

- Understanding the importance of unit testing in software development.
- Implement unit tests using the unittest framework.
- Write test cases to validate the functionality and behavior of the implemented classes.

### Serialization and deserialization of a class:

- Learn how to convert objects into a serialized format (e.g., JSON) for storage or transmission.
- Deserialize the serialized data to reconstruct the object.

### Reading and writing JSON files:

- Understand the basics of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and its use as a data interchange format.
- Read JSON data from a file and parse it into usable objects.
- Write data in JSON format to a file.

### Working with *args:

- Understand the purpose and usage of the *args syntax in Python.
- Use *args to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function or method.

### Working with **kwargs:

- Understand the purpose and usage of the **kwargs syntax in Python.
- Use **kwargs to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function or method.

## Handling named arguments in a function:

- Understand how to define functions that accept named arguments.
- Utilize named arguments to provide flexibility and clarity in function calls.

## Implementation
In this project, the objectives are implemented through the creation of classes for rectangles and squares in Python. The code includes various methods and functionalities for working with these shapes, including calculating area, displaying the shapes, updating attributes, and converting them to dictionaries.

The implemented classes are thoroughly tested using the unittest framework. The test cases cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the correctness and robustness of the implemented functionalities.
